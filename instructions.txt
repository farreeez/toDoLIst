I want to learn typescript, react and c# I have used react and c# before with js but I am rusty as I havent used them in a while. to practice and learn typescript I want to make a to do list app that has a frontend and backend, but I want to be efficient and spend the time learning the technical stuff quickly rather than thinking about the app design.

This is where you come in. Your task is to write me a new comprehensive markdown document that will guide me in my work and you should work autonomously and deeply without seeking help from me until you produce an in depth doc that has everything I want to know (please make sure to include detailed steps about setting up the boilerplate and assume that I dont know anything give very detailed steps that allow me to skim asw in case I already know the thing).

I essentially want you to take care of the thinking about the design decisions and technical decisions so that I can solely focus on technically applying it. thanks in advance

avoid giving me too much code. I want to do the coding myself

also please make the steps follow best conventions so for example in the backend you should have a controllers folder data folder that follows normal repository patterns
mappings migrations models etc 

and for the frontend you should have components context files hooks pages routing api etc try to make it as detailed as possible I want to just follow your instructions think hard and long.

make the md file called design.md
